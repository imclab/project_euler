 # DESCRIPTION : Solves problem 40 of Project Euler
 An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:

0.123456789101112131415161718192021...

It can be seen that the 12th digit of the fractional part is 1.

If d_n represents the nth digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression.
d_1  d_10  d_100  d_1000  d_10000  d_100000  d_1000000
