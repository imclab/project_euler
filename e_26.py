 # DESCRIPTION : Solves problem 26 of Project Euler
 A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

 1/2	= 	0.5
 1/3	= 	0.(3)
 1/4	= 	0.25
 1/5	= 	0.2
 1/6	= 	0.1(6)
 1/7	= 	0.(142857)
 1/8	= 	0.125
 1/9	= 	0.(1)
 1/10	= 	0.1
 Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

 Find the value of d  1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.
