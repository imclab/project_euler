#My solutions to Project Euler 's website

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) is a website containing lots of problems aiming at being solved.
I play around with them in order to sharpen my algorithm skills. 

This is always challenging to solve problems on paper and fantastic to come up with an algorithmic solution. 
I use Python for its simplicity. Simple Python code is very similar to paper solution, and fast to implement.

Each script runs by itself and contains one of several functions that directly solve the function. Thus, running a script should give you the answer directly. 

The script are named as e_problemnumber_inc. The higher the inc, the finer my solution. 

Here is a list of all already solved problems, with a one line explanation. 
Should be used in order to help future reuse of code :)
